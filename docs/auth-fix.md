# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Issue

The application was experiencing an error when making API calls:

```
Error calling API: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'currentUser')
```

This error occurred because the `auth` object was undefined when trying to access `auth.currentUser` in the API plugin.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by two factors:

1. The API plugin (`plugins/api.ts`) was being loaded before the Firebase plugin (`plugins/firebase.ts`) due to alphabetical ordering.
2. There was no null check for the `auth` object before trying to access `auth.currentUser`.

## Solution

The solution involved two key changes:

1. **Added a null check for the `auth` object**:
   - Before accessing `auth.currentUser`, we now check if `auth` is defined.
   - If `auth` is undefined, we log a warning and proceed with the original fetch without trying to add the authentication token.

2. **Ensured correct plugin loading order**:
   - Renamed the plugins with numeric prefixes to control the loading order:
     - `plugins/firebase.ts` → `plugins/1.firebase.ts`
     - `plugins/api.ts` → `plugins/2.api.ts`
   - This ensures that the Firebase plugin is loaded before the API plugin.

## Code Changes

### 1. Added null check in the API plugin:

```javascript
// Before
const user = auth.currentUser;

// After
if (!auth) {
  console.warn('Auth is not initialized yet');
  return originalFetch(request, options);
}
const user = auth.currentUser;
```

### 2. Renamed plugins to control loading order:

- Created `plugins/1.firebase.ts` with the same content as `plugins/firebase.ts`
- Created `plugins/2.api.ts` with the updated content from `plugins/api.ts`
- Removed the original plugin files

## Testing

The fix should be tested by:

1. Making API calls from the frontend while not logged in
2. Making API calls from the frontend while logged in
3. Verifying that no errors occur in either case

## Future Considerations

For future development:

1. Consider using a more robust plugin dependency system if available
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for authentication-related issues
3. Consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed API calls due to authentication issues
